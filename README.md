## Abstract

When flights arrive after the scheduled time, it is considered as a delay, which is primarily caused by many factors. Flight delays are inconvenient for passengers and can result in significant financial losses for both airlines and countries. To address this issue, an organized prediction system is essential for aviation authorities to minimize flight delays. The goal of this project is to create a two-part machine learning system that can accurately predict the arrival delay of a flight in minutes after takeoff using real-time flight and airport data. The first stage of the system is a classifier that predicts if the delay of flight is acceptable or not. And in a second part, a regression model is used to predict the amount of time the flight will be delayed upon arrival.

## Code Walkthrough
This repository contains a Python script and images for a two-part machine learning system that accurately predicts the arrival delay of a flight in minutes after takeoff using real-time flight and airport data.

## Overview

Flight delays are a major issue for passengers, airlines, and states, causing significant financial losses. To address this problem, this project aims to create a prediction system that can minimize flight delays using machine learning. The system consists of two parts: a classifier that predicts if the delay of flight is acceptable or not, and a regression model that predicts the amount of time the flight will be delayed upon arrival.
